Mouse Cancer Study Analysis
In this challange, the analysis using a mouse cancer study dataset included data cleaning, visualisation and correlation analysis using Python and relevant libraries.

Analysis Steps
1. Data Cleaning: Duplicates and irrelevant columns was clean and removed from the dataset.

2. Summary Statistics: Key statistics such as mean, median, variance and standard deviation of tumor volumes were calculated for each drug regimen

3. Visualisation: Four different charts were used in the dataset eg. a bar plot for drug regimen observations, a pie plot for gender distribution and line/ scatter plots for tumor volume trends

4. Correlation and Regression: The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume was calculated. A linear regression model was used to predict the relationship.

Findings
  Capomulin and Ramicane regimens showed lower average tumor volumes.

  Mouse gender distribution was balanced in the study

  Tumor volume generally decreased over time for Capomulin-treated mice

  There was a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume in the Capomulin regimen
